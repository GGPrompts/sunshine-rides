# Canvas Design Gallery

A collection of visual art pieces created using the canvas-design skill. Each project follows a design philosophy that treats abstract concepts through visual language—minimal text, maximum spatial expression.

## 1. Gravitational Presence (Memory Force)

**Philosophy:** *Memory as Invisible Force*

> "Memory is not narrative—it is force. Like gravity itself, it curves space around its presence, pulls objects into orbit, and shapes the trajectory of all matter nearby."

This piece treats memory through the visual language of distortion fields: warped grids revealing invisible pressure, orbital patterns of recalled moments held in tension, geometry reorganized by accumulated weight.

**Visual Approach:**
- Deep penetrating backgrounds establishing the void
- Precious metals (gold traces, platinum pathways) suggesting crystallized value
- Precision geometry—machine-measured yet hand-labored quality
- Typography restricted to whispered labels, technical annotations

**Location:** `projects/memory-force/`
**Files:** Philosophy, script, PDF & PNG outputs

## 2. Mnemonic Fields

**Philosophy:** *Invisible Forces as Tangible Matter*

> "This visual language treats invisible forces as tangible matter—the pull of past moments rendered as physical phenomena... cartography of the intangible, executed with the precision of master astronomical diagrams."

Field lines trace paths of force, measurements annotate invisible tension, and formulaic notation suggests that emotional experiences operate according to discoverable laws.

**Visual Approach:**
- Vast negative space mirroring infinite void
- Concentrated luminous masses glowing with accumulated energy
- Limited palette: midnight blues to purple-blacks, warm golds and ambers
- Sans-serif notations floating like technical marginalia
- Clean vector precision, flawless alignment, perfect breathing room

**Location:** `projects/mnemonic-fields/`
**Files:** Philosophy, script, multiple iterations (v1, refined, final, masterpiece)

## 3. Gravitational Recall

**Philosophy:** *Systematic Study of Intangible Phenomena*

> "This movement treats invisible forces as observable phenomena, borrowing the visual language of physics and systematic study to map the unmappable."

Intangible experiences possess measurable properties—mass, trajectory, field strength, decay—deserving the same analytical rigor as observable natural laws.

**Visual Approach:**
- Systematic accumulation through dense clusters of marks and shapes
- Grids, coordinates, reference systems as structural frameworks
- Clinical color restraint: 4-5 calibrated tones
- Deep voids (navy, charcoal, black) as ground for phenomena
- Patient mark-making: dots in density maps, parallel lines for field strength
- Thin sans-serif numerals marking coordinates

**Location:** `projects/gravitational-recall/`
**Files:** Philosophy, 3 scripts (initial, SVG, refined), PNG & SVG outputs

## Design Principles

All projects embody core principles:

1. **Visual-First Communication** - Ideas expressed through space, form, color, composition—not paragraphs
2. **Minimal Text** - Typography as rare, essential punctuation; never explanatory blocks
3. **Expert Craftsmanship** - Meticulous refinement, countless hours of calibration
4. **Systematic Aesthetics** - Color palettes as functional systems, not arbitrary decoration
5. **Spatial Intelligence** - Negative space thick with meaning, elements positioned by force

## Technical Details

- **Tools:** Python (Pillow/PIL)
- **Output Formats:** PNG, PDF, SVG
- **Resolution:** High DPI for museum-quality prints
- **Dimensions:** Typically 1920x2400+ for poster formats

## Usage

Each project can be regenerated:
```bash
cd projects/<project-name>
python3 create_*.py
```

See individual project directories for philosophy documents and generation scripts.

*"This is design that announces its own rigor, that proves through its execution someone labored over every detail with painstaking attention."*
